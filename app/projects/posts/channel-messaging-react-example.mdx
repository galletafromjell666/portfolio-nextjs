Two-way communication between a parent window and an iframe is a common requirement in web development. The MessageChannel API provides an elegant way to establish this communication by creating two connected ports (port1 and port2). Here's a small project demonstrating how to set up such communication:

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/galletafromjell666/channel-messaging-react-example)

## The Idea
- Parent Frame: Creates a MessageChannel and stores port1 in a ref, listens for the iframe's load event, and sends port2 to the iframe using postMessage.
- Iframe: Sets up a listener for the message event, stores port2 in a ref, and uses it for two-way communication with the parent.
