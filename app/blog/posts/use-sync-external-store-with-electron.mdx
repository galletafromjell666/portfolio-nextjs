summary: "useSyncExternalStore is a not-so-popular React hook, but it's super useful for subscribing to an external source and storing its data—no useEffect or useState needed."

This entry shows how to use the `useSyncExternalStore` hook to subscribe to an API exposed in Electron. 
This hook is perfect for the job, as it provides the right tools for seamless state synchronization. 
While we could achieve a similar result with `useEffect` and `useState`, `useSyncExternalStore` offers a more efficient approach.

The complete code for this example is on this [repository](https://github.com/galletafromjell666/use-sync-external-store-w-electron)

## Preparing the main process
We want to send data from `process.getSystemMemoryInfo()` to the renderer process. To achieve this, we need to periodically fetch the data using setInterval after the mainWindow has been created and the app is ready.
```ts
setInterval(() => {
    const memoryUsage = process.getSystemMemoryInfo()
    console.log(memoryUsage)
    mainWindow.webContents.send('memory-usage', memoryUsage)
  }, 1000)
```
This will send memory info data to the renderer process every second.

## Preparing the preload script
We need to safely expose an API to receive system memory info.

To do this, we declare an api object in our preload script with a property called `onMemorySystemInfoUpdate`. This property is a function that takes a callback, which runs whenever we receive a `memory-usage` event from the main process.

We also return a function to unsubscribe from all listeners. This is super important since there's a limit on listeners, and we don’t want to leave unnecessary ones running.
```ts
export const api = {
  onMemorySystemInfoUpdate: (callback) => {
    ipcRenderer.on('memory-usage', (_event, data) => callback(data))

    // Return a cleanup function
    return (): void => {
      console.log("[preload] Removing listener from ipcRenderer 'memory-usage'")
      ipcRenderer.removeAllListeners('memory-usage')
    }
  }
}

```
To expose this API to the renderer, we use contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld, passing the key 'api' and the api object we just created.

```ts
contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld('api', api)
```

## Implementing our store with `useSyncExternalStore`
Now we can finally start working in our renderer code, we start creating a type for the data we receive from the main process
```ts
export interface SystemMemoryInfo {
  total: number
  free: number
  swapTotal: number
  swapFree: number
}
```

And then we create a memoryStore object with the following keys:
- data: Initially is just an empty object, but it will store the data received from the main process.
- listeners: A JavaScript set that holds callback functions from components (or hooks) subscribed to the store. We call these callbacks whenever the store data updates to notify subscribers of changes.
- subscribe: A function that takes a callback and adds it to the listeners set. It returns a cleanup function that removes the callback from the set when unsubscribed.
- update: A function that receives SystemMemoryInfo data, updates the data property, and notifies subscribers about the change.
- getSnapshot: A function that returns a snapshot of the store’s data. It acts as a simple selector. in our case, it just returns `memoryStore.data`.
- removeIpcListener: Initially a void function, but after we subscribe to `onMemorySystemInfoUpdate` it stores the function returned by `onMemorySystemInfoUpdate`.

Our object should look like:
```ts
const memoryStore = {
  data: {} as SystemMemoryInfo,
  listeners: new Set<() => void>(),
  removeIpcListener: (): void => {},

  getSnapshot(): SystemMemoryInfo {
    // This acts like a selector
    return memoryStore.data
  },

  subscribe(listener: () => void): () => void {
    console.log('[useSystemMemory] Adding new subscriber')
    memoryStore.listeners.add(listener)

    return () => {
      // Clean up
      memoryStore.listeners.delete(listener)
    }
  },

  update(data: SystemMemoryInfo): void {
    memoryStore.data = data
    // Notify each listener
    memoryStore.listeners.forEach((listener) => listener())
  }
}
```

We add the code to subscribe to `onMemorySystemInfoUpdate`. It's important to store the returned function so we can unsubscribe before the script unloads:
```ts
memoryStore.removeIpcListener = window.api.onMemorySystemInfoUpdate((value) => {
  console.log('[useSystemMemory] Received new value from main:', value)
  memoryStore.update(value)
})
```

To unsubscribe, we simply listen for the beforeunload event on window and call `memoryStore.removeIpcListener()`:
```ts
window.addEventListener('beforeunload', (): void => {
  memoryStore.removeIpcListener()
})
```

Now we can (finally) start working on our React code. We'll create a hook that returns data from `memoryStore`:
```ts
import { useSyncExternalStore } from 'react'

function useSystemMemory(): SystemMemoryInfo {
  return useSyncExternalStore(memoryStore.subscribe, memoryStore.getSnapshot)
}
```
Our hook simplify returns  `useSyncExternalStore`, passing `memoryStore.subscribe` and `memoryStore.getSnapshot` as arguments.
It is pretty straightforward. Our hook ensures a single source of truth and will cause a re-render whenever the data updates.

And the code to consume our custom hook is:
```ts
const systemMemoryInfo = useSystemMemory()
```
